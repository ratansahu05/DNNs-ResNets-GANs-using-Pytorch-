Explored Deep Neural Networks, Improved and Optimised them using ResNets and Executed GANs Fundamentals
Created a deep neural network with hidden layers using a non-linear activation function ReLU and trained the model on a
GPU to speed up training and experimented with hyperparameters to improve the performance metrics of the model
Optimized the DNNâ€™s accuracy over 90 % by using Residual Networks,Data Augmentation,Data normalization and trained
the model using improvements such as Learning Rate Scheduling(one-cycle policy),Weight Decay and Gradient Clipping
Explored Generative Adversial Networks(GANs) to perform an unsupervised learning task in machine learning to
generate new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset using Generator and Discriminator
